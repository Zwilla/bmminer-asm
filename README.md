# bmminer-asm
bmminer-assembler-code
This is the assembler code for bmminer from bitmain
it is modified to take the real name cgminer

I will also upload the new binary

changes

only rename bmminer into cgminer, to that what it is.

I hope the github team will not delete this binary, if yes?! Here is a link to it also:
